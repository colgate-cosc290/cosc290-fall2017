## Instructions

Please work with a partner.  You may choose your own partner this time.  If it is a different partner than the last time, please let me know.  If you want a partner, please let me know (or post a request on piazza).

## Assignment

Write up answers to the following questions.  Please use Markdown for most questions.  The last question requires implementation and I have provided some starter code [here](https://github.com/colgate-cosc290/cosc290-fall2017/tree/master/labs/lab10).

You may want to *start* with the last problem, which will help you gain a concrete understanding of Bloom filters and then go back and look at the previous "pencil and paper" questions.

Problems 10.99 - 10.104.
